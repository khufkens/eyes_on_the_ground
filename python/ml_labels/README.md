# Machine learning code

This code has been developed by DVARA e-registry, and labels images for several disturbances. Only a small subset of the original data was used in training due to the time intensive nature of evaluating all images.

Label data are back filled using these models, values reported include classification probabilities, or where applicable values and their probabilities.

Machine learning labels should be used with caution as this represents an estimate of the true class, but can be helpful in either further screeing or as an augmentation method.
