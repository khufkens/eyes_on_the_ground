# Eyes on the ground: Providing quality model training data through smartphone images of crops

Processing code to create a unique dataset of at least 35,000 timestamped georeferenced crop images, along with various labels on input use, crop management, phenology, crop damage and yields.

This data will have valuable contributions in applications such as crop modeling, agricultural finance and insurance, agricultural advisories, and early warning systems. 

This project is a collaboration between ACRE, IFPRI, CGIAR Big Data, and the Lacuna Fund.
